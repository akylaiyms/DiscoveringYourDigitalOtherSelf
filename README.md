# DiscoveringYourDigitalOtherSelf
Discovering Your Digital Other Self is a project developed as my thesis work at Bennington College. 

Artist Statement 

How is data being collected? And how much of it is collected through our daily used devices? How much of it is captured through sound? In this piece, Discovering Your Other Digital Self, I am creating an alter-ego by putting together endless pieces of information that my electronic devices are capturing through sound. Since phones are an irreplaceable part of our everyday life, I decided to use mine as a foundation for this piece. 	
How is it like being inside your phone’s ‘head’ and recording all of these arbitrary things and making sense out of them? I have decided to create a semi-virtual reality to experience my phone’s point of view as close as I can.
All of the sounds here are processed field recordings from my everyday life. You can hear conversations, whispers, space ambiances, and different daily activities. The sounds are being separately fed to an algorithm that generates random combinations of four sound stems. I think computerizing the sound output through a random algorithm gives a better sense of having your phone’s POV. That creates a sense of chaos and ambiguity as the algorithm is searching through a huge pool of data while capturing more and more information. 
The visual patterns are the representations of how a single ‘drop’ of new data falling into the ocean of information triggers the algorithm to find infinite possibilities of different connections and meanings.  
You get into your phone’s head and hear yourself from its point of view. The message I am trying to carry through this piece is to make the audience simply aware of the amount of information we are unconsciously feeding into the algorithms through sound. I am not trying to argue that the issue of data collection is neither good nor bad, but simply keeping a neutral ground and exploring the process of data collection.
